/*

Handheld Hover
==============

The mixin sets the hover and focus states of a selector
at the desktop-only breakpoint, and an active state for all
breakpoints. It assumes that all states are styled the same.

Use if you encounter a "sticky" hover state on a mobile device.

Usage: `.element { @include hover { text-decoration: underline; }; }`
